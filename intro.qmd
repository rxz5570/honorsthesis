# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The most pressing issue facing the global community is climate change and global warming, which has instigated the re-examination and discussion of concerns regarding current energy and fuel resources. Cutting-edge technology and machine learning have enabled new discoveries and improvements on existing solutions to this imminent crisis, such as new and innovative methods of capturing greenhouse cases.

Recent research points to prioritizing the capture, storage, and use of methane emissions as a potential solution to the fuel crisis. The removal of methane can lead to significant improvements in overall air quality and decreases in global warming since it is the second most abundant greenhouse gas and extremely potent in trapping heat [@jordan_removing_2021]. The combined risk factor associated with methane's high flammability and lack of existing research on methane capture and energy efficient conversions to fuel makes it challenging to safely work with. However, it offers promising potential to be a source of energy that surpasses other fossil fuels as a solution to the fuel crisis. Furthermore, significant removal of methane can lead to drastic decreases in overall global temperatures and the issue of global warming since methane is the direct contributor to an increase in the tropospheric ozone layer [@jordan_removing_2021].

Zeolites, a class of crystalline, microporous inorganic solid consisting of silicon and oxygen atoms, offer a safe and reliable solution to storing and transporting methane and other volatile gases, such as carbon dioxide, without further emitting pollutants. This research focuses on combining and improving existing algorithms for inorganic solids design of 3D atomic-scale periodic structures of zeolites. The merge of the generative adversarial network, ZeoGAN, and a multi-tasking graph convolutional neural network model, HydraGNN.

ZeoGAN, or zeolite GAN, is an existing basic GAN model with the goal of generating crystalline porous nanomaterials and energy shapes using artificial neural networks, while HydraGNN predicts global and atomic physical properties given atomic structures. Using a high-performance organization procedure, The integration of HydraGNN as a function within the ZeoGAN algorithm allows for the generation of new atomic structures with low energies or any optimization of user-desired properties.



This research is conducted in conjointment with the AI Initiative in the Department of Computational Chemistry and Nanomaterials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. (ask Dr. Irle what credits need to be added?)
