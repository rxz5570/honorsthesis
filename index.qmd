# Abstract {.unnumbered}



The general idea of this iterative process is to train ZeoGAN to produce crys-
talline porous structures with low energies from the energy values obtained
from HydraGNN. The input configuration for HydraGNN is in Cartesian
coordinates format, while the output of ZeoGAN is the crystal lattice infor-
mation of a materials' grid, specially the probabilities an atom exists at
every coordinate in the unit cell. Thus, in order to integrate the HydraGNN
as a function within ZeoGAN and form this iterative process, the output of ZeoGAN must be converted into this Cartesian format. My primary assign-
ment was to develop an algorithm which can be implemented in ZeoGAN to
accurately do this conversion and will be used to train HydraGNN. I am also
working on creating visualizations of the 3D molecular structures to confirm
and assess the accuracy of the material grids of the structures generated from
ZeoGAN, which is difficult to do with only the given data.
