	abstract = {Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI/ML) methods are beginning to have signiﬁcant impact in chemistry and condensed matter physics. For example, deep learning methods have demonstrated new capabilities for high-throughput virtual screening, and global optimization approaches for inverse design of materials. Recently, a relatively new branch of AI/ML, deep generative models (GMs), provide additional promise as they encode material structure and/or properties into a latent space, and through exploration and manipulation of the latent space can generate new materials. These approaches learn representations of a material structure and its corresponding chemistry or physics to accelerate materials discovery, which differs from traditional AI/ML methods that use statistical and combinatorial screening of existing materials via distinct structure-property relationships. However, application of GMs to inorganic materials has been notably harder than organic molecules because inorganic structure is often more complex to encode. In this work we review recent innovations that have enabled GMs to accelerate inorganic materials discovery. We focus on different representations of material structure, their impact on inverse design strategies using variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, and highlight the potential of these approaches for discovering materials with targeted properties needed for technological innovation.},

              We introduce a multi-tasking graph convolutional neural network, HydraGNN, to simultaneously predict
              both global and atomic
              physical properties and demonstrate with ferromagnetic materials. We train HydraGNN on an open-source
              ab initio
              density functional theory (DFT) dataset for iron-platinum with a fixed body centered tetragonal lattice structure and fixed volume to simultaneously predict the mixing enthalpy (a global feature of the system), the atomic charge transfer, and the atomic magnetic moment across configurations that span the entire compositional range. By taking advantage of underlying physical correlations between material properties, multi-task learning (MTL) with HydraGNN provides effective training even with modest amounts of data. Moreover, this is achieved with just one architecture instead of three, as required by single-task learning (STL). The first convolutional layers of the HydraGNN architecture are shared by all learning tasks and extract features common to all material properties. The following layers discriminate the features of the different properties, the results of which are fed to the separate heads of the final layer to produce predictions. Numerical results show that HydraGNN effectively captures the relation between the configurational entropy and the material properties over the entire compositional range. Overall, the accuracy of simultaneous MTL predictions is comparable to the accuracy of the STL predictions. In addition, the computational cost of training HydraGNN for MTL is much lower than the original DFT calculations and also lower than training separate STL models for each property.},

In addressing this challenge, generative models can oﬀer new opportunities since they allow for the continuous navigation of chemical space via latent spaces. In this work, we employ a crystal representation that is inversion-free based on unit cell and fractional atomic coordinates and build a generative adversarial network for crystal structures. The proposed model is applied to generate the Mg−Mn−O ternary materials with the theoretical evaluation of their photoanode properties for high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). The proposed generative HTVS framework predicts 23 new crystal structures with reasonable calculated stability and band gap. These ﬁndings suggest that the generative model can be an eﬀective way to explore hidden portions of the chemical space, an area that is usually unreachable when conventional substitutionbased discovery is employed.},

              Performance limit is an important metric that can determine the commercial feasibility of a given class of materials. Here, an artificial neural network is used to generate crystalline nanoporous materials (
              i.e.
              shapes) in the energy space, and molecular simulations are conducted directly on a large number of these generated shapes to obtain the performance limits. A test application of methane storage in zeolites reveals excellent agreement in the methane working capacity values of top performing structures between the real zeolites and the shapes generated from our neural network. Moreover, even when the real zeolites with the highest working capacity values are excluded from the input training sets, our neural network generates shapes that yield large working capacity values that are close to the true maximum value. With further development, this method can be extended to other applications and materials, thereby providing rational guidance to construct reasonable performance targets for future development of materials.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the evolution of biological systems, genetic algorithms have been applied to generate solutions for optimization problems in a variety of scientiﬁc and engineering disciplines. For a given problem, a suitable genome representation must be deﬁned along with a mutation operator to generate subsequent generations. Unlike natural systems which display a variety of complex rearrangements (e.g. mobile genetic elements), mutation for genetic algorithms commonly utilizes only random point-wise changes. Furthermore, generalizing beyond point-wise mutations poses a key difﬁculty as useful genome rearrangements depend on the representation and problem domain. To move beyond the limitations of manually deﬁned point-wise changes, here we propose the use of techniques from masked language models to automatically generate mutations. As a ﬁrst step, common subsequences within a given population are used to generate a vocabulary. The vocabulary is then used to tokenize each genome. A masked language model is trained on the tokenized data in order to generate possible rearrangements (i.e. mutations). In order to illustrate the proposed strategy, we use string representations of molecules and use a genetic algorithm to optimize for drug-likeness and synthesizability. Our results show that moving beyond random point-wise mutations accelerates genetic algorithm optimization.},
