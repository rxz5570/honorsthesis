<p align="justify">Energy is essential for survival for all living 
things on Earth. We use it almost every day to power our automobiles, 
the buildings we work in, and our smart phones when we need to send a 
message to a friend. Fossil fuels have largely been our main source of 
energy, accounting for 86% of US energy consumption in the form of 
petroleum, coal, and natural gas. [1] Alternative sources of energy have 
improved in the hopes of meeting the energy needs in a more 
environmentally friendly way, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric 
energy with greater success over the past few years. [2] Despite great 
progress, they still greatly lag behind the rate at which we consume 
fossil fuel resources, where there is a large amount of evidence 
pointing towards their deleterious effect on the environment ranging 
from global warming to the very habitat that supports life.</p>

<p align="justify">Recent developments spearheaded by multiple countries 
with harnessing methane have made it a promising source of energy that 
could overtake other fossil fuel energy sources (Fig.1). It is 
considered to be a cleaner alternative to oil and coal, is richer in 
carbon, and found abundantly in nature. However, methane is considered a 
more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and can be hazardous to 
store and manage. [3] Here we highlight both the benefits and downsides 
of increasing our efforts to harvest methane and what might be best 
moving forward to support our energy needs while minimizing damage 
induced on our environment.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Methane</h2>

<p align="justify">Methane is produced through a variety of sources. 
Human activity has been known to produce copious amounts of methane 
through rice farming, livestock farming, landfills, biomass burning, and 
even coal mining. Natural sources include cellulose-disgesting bacteria, 
or methanogens, in the gut of termites or in the wetlands. Methane is 
produced through two major pathways under anaerobic conditions, where 
(1) carbon dioxide is reduced with hydrogen, fatty acids, or alcohols as 
hydrogen donors and (2) transmethylation of acetic acid 
(CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) or methyl alcohol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH). Although this 
phenomenon is well understood, calculating the actual net amount is a 
bit complicated since methane can be consumed in overlying aerobic 
layers. Nevertheless, current estimates put methane production on the 
order of millions of tonnes. [4]</p>

<p align="justify">One source in particular has gained much attention 
over the past few years. Methane clathrate, or more colloquially known 
as "fire ice", is found as an ice crystal with natural methane gas 
locked inside, formed through the combination of low temperatures and 
high pressure. One cubic meter of the compound releases about 160 cubic 
meters of gas, making it a highly energy-intensive fuel. [5] A large 
portion of methane can be found distributed primarily within permafrost 
regions and in continental slode sediments. [6] Evidence shows that 
these deposits are enormous, with more energy stored in methane hydrates 
compared to the world's oil, coal and gas combined. Methane produces 
energy in the form of heat when ignited through oxidative pyrolysis. The 
following reaction equations describe this process: [4]</p>

<p align="justify">Recent efforts especially by Japan have proven to be 
fruitful, where there is an estimated 6 trillion cubic meters of methane 
hydrate in sedimentary basins nearby. [7]</p>

    <h2>Downsides of Methane</h2>

<p align="justify">Storing and utilizing methane can be tricky and poses 
potential problems that may exacerbate the global warming issue we are 
currently facing today. It is highly flammable, which increases the risk 
of combustion given ideal conditions. [3] In addition, methane is 
considered to be 20-30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas compared to 
carbon dioxide. [4] Therefore, with the impending rise of temperature 
around the world, it is not too difficult to imagine a scenario when 
permafrost and methane hydrates will begin to thaw, releasing trillions 
of cubic meters of methane into the atmosphere and consequently 
accelerating global warming. Another source of methane from agriculture 
and ruminants also makes it difficult to figure out how these sources 
can be curtailed when the demand for meat and crops will not subside 
anytime soon. [8] Landfills within developing worlds are not entirely 
equipped to be able to contain methane that is being produced in the 
presence of methanogens. Combined with the current lack of resources for 
collecting methane in a reliable manner and its ability to trap heat 
within the earth's atmosphere makes methane a lot more difficult to 
handle and potentially unwieldy and dangerous.</p>

    <h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p align="justify">Despite environmental concerns, methane is still 
considered to be a better alterative to other fossil fuel sources and 
efforts are certainly underway to make it a leading source of energy in 
the future. Experts believe that the release of methane from clathrates 
are believed to be slow and chronic rather than catastrophic, and much 
of it may never reach the atmosphere. [8] However, it is probably for 
the best if we could minimize the amount of energy we all use over time, 
which could then alleviate demand and furthermore preserve whatever fuel 
sources we still have on Earth. Unfortunately, we don't have an infinite 
amount of resources and our ability to be frugal with what we have may 
be what saves us in the coming decades.</p>
